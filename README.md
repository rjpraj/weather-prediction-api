# weather-pridiction-api

This project is created as per the requirements of the assignment provided by publicis sapient.
The purpose of this project is to consume the OpenWeatherMap api .

### Design Principles :
This api has been developed using SOLID design principles. More info about SOLID
design principles can be found on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID

### Requirements:

The assignment

â€¢ Develop, test and deploy a micro service to show the output of a city's next 3 days high and low temperatures.
If rain is predicted in next 3 days or temperature goes above 40 degree celsius then mention 'Carry umbrella' or
'Use sunscreen lotion' respectively, in the output, for that day.



## Tech Stack

* Since I am java programmer and I've been using spring framework from past 3 years .
  The choice was quite obvious to use Spring Boot .
  Other than spring boot , maven , junit, docker , swagger, tomcat were used.

## Installation

This project is java-based. So It requires Jdk 8 (or later) and Maven 3.8.6 (or later)  to run.

```sh
$ cd weather-pridiction-api
$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/weather-pridiction-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 
```

Or if there is need to build new image then it can also be build and pushed to
docker hub via

```sh
$ cd weather-pridiction-api
$ mvn jib:build
```


## Running tests
After changes you can run tests using Maven command:
```sh
$ cd weather-pridiction-api
$ mvn test
```

## Rest API

As required, this API has 1 endpoint :
1. /v1/weather/{city}


## Testing API
1. API can be tested using Postman/Soap Ui
2. Swagger is also included in api , I would suggest to use swagger then there is no need to perform extra work.

## Things included in current version :
1. JavaDocs are also included, to generate javadocs use
   ```
   $cd weather-pridiction-api
   $ mvn javadoc:javadoc
   ```
   Then go to the folder /target/site/apidocs

2. Google's code convention is being forced via the checkstyle.xml.
3. Swagger is included and automatic update of swagger specification is done.

## Things to be included in future version :
1. CI/CD should also be implemented for this api.
2. If we want to move to microservioces architecture then probably we can look for Netflix OSS
   (apigateway , service descovery , cloud config etc.)
3. Current version doesn't support maven/spring profiles , which needs to be implemented.
